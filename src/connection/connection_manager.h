// Transport-agnostic connection lifecycle manager.
//
// Manages the connection state machine for a client node that communicates
// with a remote coordinator. All transport-specific logic (channel scanning,
// peer management, reconnect probes) is delegated to an ISessionProvider.
//
// The connection manager only knows about:
//   - heartbeats (has the coordinator spoken recently?)
//   - probes (ask the session provider to try reaching the coordinator)
//   - discovery (ask the session provider to find a new coordinator)
//   - state transitions based on timeouts and events
